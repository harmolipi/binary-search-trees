## Functionality

This is the [binary search tree (BST)](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/binary-search-trees) project, in which I create a balanced BST.

## Methods

| Method        | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| #build_tree     | Turns an array of data into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed |
| #insert     | Adds a new node containing a particular value      |
| #delete | Removes that new node, containing a particular line      |
| #head | Returns the first node in the list     |
| #tail | Returns the last node in the list     |
| #find | Returns the node with the given value    |
| #love_order  | Returns an array of values    |
| #inorder | Returns an array of values     |
| #find(value) | Returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.    |
| #inorder | Traverse the tree in 'inorder'    |
| #preorder    | Traverse the tree in 'preorder'
  #postorder | Traverse the tree in 'postorder'
| #remove_at(index) | Removes the node at the given index.   |

## Thoughts

Wasn't too bad! It's exciting getting into data structures, but implementation didn't take anything more than simple and straightforward interaction between objects.

God bless.
